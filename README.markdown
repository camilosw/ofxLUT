#ofxLUT
##by Roy Macdonald.

Developed at the OF WWDC 2012 held in Detroit on Feb'12.

###openFrameworks addon for filtering images using 3D LUTs (Look Up Tables).
3D LUTs is a very common format for saving color modifications. These are widely used by color grading software and are very easy to find all over the www.

###Example
The included example is part of the examples of of0071.
Yet here I converted the code into an addon so to easily take advantage of the 3D LUTs.
This example comes with some 3D LUTs that simulate the color filters used by Instagram.



###TODO:
integrate LUT processing through an OpenGL shader. This shaders are already done by patricioGonzalezVivo, yet not integrated to this addon.
